    "description": "Founded in 2004, Facebook’s mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover what’s going on in the world, and to share and express what matters to them.\n\nFacebook is defined by our unique culture – one that rewards impact. We encourage people to be bold and solve the problems they care most about. We work in small teams and move fast to develop new products, constantly iterating. The phrase “this journey is 1% finished,” reminds us that we’ve only begun to fulfill our mission to bring the world closer together. \n\nFor a full listings of our jobs, visit www.facebook.com/careers\n\n*We created this community to share information about careers at Facebook including employee stories, current openings, and inside looks at particular teams.
